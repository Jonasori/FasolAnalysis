# Fasola Project

A bored Sunday becomes some silly data analysis.


## Files
* **get_data.py** A scraper to pull the relevant data from fasola.org
* **analysis.py** Some plotting stuff


## Results
We can plot the popularity of a single song's popularity through the years:

Or we can make a gif of the popularity of a selection of songs through time.
